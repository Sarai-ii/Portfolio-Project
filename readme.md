# üçΩ WHAT'S'DISH üçΩ - Porfolio Project

## Skills Applied:
- Deploying a front-end application
- Allowing for user interaction through button clicks and form inputs
- Requesting from two external APIs
- Creative design and development
- Vanilla Javascript back-end development

## Api Used:

[**Meals Api**](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

<br>

[**Cocktails Api**](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

## Functionality: 
This site was created to mimic a realistic online recipe site where a user can search manually for a recipe based on the name of the meal or with keywords indicated within a specific meal. The website will generate information form the API database and will pull a recipe that best matches the inputted keyword/keywords. This can be found at the [recipes](https://sarai-ii.github.io/Portfolio-Project/recipes.html) subpage of the site. 

Also, this site has an additional two subpages that are generated on load with random recipes, one for cusines found around the world, found [here](https://sarai-ii.github.io/Portfolio-Project/country.html), and the other for 
[cocktails](https://sarai-ii.github.io/Portfolio-Project/cocktails.html) that will pair perfectly with your meal.

## Purpose

I wanted to create a site that was aligned with the projects completed in the business program of my undergrad. Numerous projects consisted of peer-reviewing large corporation's and smaller brand's company site, and sought through the lens of the end-user where changes can be made for an easier navigation, cleaner apperance and faulty functionality designs. Being able to take my business marketing skills and apply that to developing my own site shows 1. how imperative it is to have a team, (no one should do it all alone) and 2. how crucial back-end is for the framework of the site's functionality and apperance.
